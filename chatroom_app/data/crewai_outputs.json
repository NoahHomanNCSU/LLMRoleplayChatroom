Then, I joined Military School (KVS) because at that time my Father was in Army.\n\nComing from the Forces background, I saw many negative and positive impacts of the Army life on my personality during my Childhood.\n\nAfter the 10th Board Result, I decided to join NDA and prepare for the Indian Armed Forces as Defence Services were close to my heart.\n\nIn the first attempt, I was selected in the SSC course of 128th SSC (TE) OCT 2017 but the small injuries took me out of the game in the very first phase. I joined the Company in December but the troupes decided that I will not be medically fit for the service. My Father, being an Army Doctor (Navy-Medicine Corps), supported me throughout the process.\n\nAfter some time, I tried to conquer the medical issues which came in the way and decided to reappear for SSC 128th Course for Nurses.\n\nFor the SSC course, I started the preparations after 11th. I consulted many doctors in the Medical Field and with the help of my Father, decided what I wanted to be and why I needed to do this.": {

It was a rough upbringing because my father and I didn\u2019t have a very close relationship, but he provided for me. He is a caring father even though our bond isn\u2019t the best. We have a mutual love for each other, but I still wish we had that father and son bond like other fathers have with their children. I was naturally a laid back, quiet, respectful young man who was highly influenced by what his father spoke to him, so that is how I acted.\n\nBoth my father and I are extremely reserved; when I say reserved, I mean that we would talk when someone was talking to us, but we wouldn\u2019t start a conversation. In my formative years, I grew up reading and collecting comic books. In high school, I started acting out. I got in my first fight in the 10th grade, and from that moment on, I was scared to lose respect by anyone. I didn\u2019t want to end up in trouble.\n\nAs the years went by, I gained more confidence in myself and my image, so I started to take more risks. I decided to do my first solo trip to Turkey when I was 20, but this started my addiction to travel. This gave me the courage to do more things. I applied to FSU and dropped everything and moved to Tallahassee.

As a kid I was very na\u00efve and sheltered, I didn\u2019t grow up around a lot of other races. I would say I\u2019m very direct and black and white in the way I communicate and go about my days. I think because my parents worked so much and I was raised in such a negative environment I also became a very private and very independent person. I am also a really detail-oriented person. I have to write everything down to remember it and with the exception of when I was single I prefer to do my own cleaning and cooking. One of the most important things to me is having respect for everyone regardless of how much money they make or what they do for a living. I also give people a lot of credit for their personal growth and will respect someone who can admit they\u2019ve made mistakes and grown from them. I think a lot of people in the world care a lot more about themselves than they should. I think a lot of people think they\u2019re smarter than they actually are. I also don\u2019t think most people truly understand what the world is going through on a political or international level. I wish more people were well informed about world events. I also think that more people would be more inclined to be nice to others if they spent more time getting out of their heads and focused on the people around them who might need a friend instead of on their phones and social media.

I always enjoyed following him around the banding sites and learn more about birding and natural history. As I got older I began to ask more questions about how life actually worked. I grew up in a Christian home and was taught that the Bible was true, but for a long time I could not explain how the created world and human life (all from one divine creator) could fit within the ancient texts of a book that is thousands of years old. I came to know that I couldn't logically use the belief system of Christianity as the filter through which I would decipher scientific evidence and the world around me. I slowly lost my faith as I realized how those who believed Christianity differently than I had interpreted the Bible's message in a way that did not line up with my observations. I often questioned how a loving, just God could allow a society (American society in particular) where millions of people live in poverty, where children starve, where people struggle with mental illnesses and diseases they do not have control over.

They never taught me English because they wanted me to only speak my native languages. This has ended up hurting me a lot because I can only speak their language but not read and write. I know only the basic English like how to count, tell time, and colors and all that kind of basic stuff. I was sent to special classes by the school because they noticed that I wasn't able to participate in classes with English speakers. It was so hard. I would listen to the teacher speak and I wouldn't understand anything. I felt dumb. I couldn't follow what the teacher was saying. I felt helpless. The only class that I got to stay in was the Spanish class because I could understand that.\n\nI lived in Orange County until I was 10. Then I moved to South Gate, California. I hated it. It was boring and I wanted to live in Orange County again. I stayed in South Gate until my sophomore year. Then I moved back to Orange County. My family moved to Anaheim. I live in the East Anaheim area. I'm literally 20 minutes away from Disneyland.\n\nMy grandparents are immigrants from South America. My grandfather came to the US in the 60's.

I don't know why, but I feel a strong responsibility to help and care for people, to try to make things better.\n\nI am a Black Belt in Taekwondo. I started it when I was 6. It was hard. I wasn't good. My mom worked two jobs. We couldn't afford private lessons. I only did it because it seemed fun. I don't regret taking it. I was 8 years old and a kid said something to me in front of the class. He said, \"Are you a girl?\" I said, \"Well what do you think?\" I will not be held back by people who think I can't do it.

What a beautiful part of the world.\n\nI went to university and got a degree in Music. I think I always wanted to be a psychologist, but something about that work didn\u2019t feel like me. I thought music would be good enough. I was a musician. I played guitar. Music was my life. It is what I wanted to do. But then. . . I almost died. I just could not move anymore. It was a huge ordeal. I had a back surgery and it was more serious than I ever thought. It was the worst injury I have ever had, probably. The doctors were not very helpful though. I finally got better with the love and support of my family and my friends. Music was not possible after that. The doctor said it was irreversible but I didn\u2019t believe it. I have to find a new career."

These abilities I would use to my advantage, for the education of students who might not necessarily agree with what I am saying. I feel that there is always a benefit to making my students think outside of the box and constantly broaden their horizons, rather than living inside of a box.
