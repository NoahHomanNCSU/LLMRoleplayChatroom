This level provides the player with initial constructs that are spaced out and designed to introduce the player to the different kinds of blocks ('B' for Basic and 'R' for Resilient). The 'H' points are Hack Points, providing potential access to intriguing secrets and tougher boss battles. Positioned 'X' blocks will yield power-ups or enemies, offering a strategic approach to the player’s progression. The aesthetic of alternating neon patterns captures the cyberpunk essence, while varied block endurance introduces tactical depth early on in the game’s progression.
